# Vonmigs Todos
Vonmigs Todos is a minimal yet powerful task management tool designed to streamline your weekly workflow. Whether you prefer a structured list or a dynamic Kanban board, Agenda gives you the flexibility to create, organize, and track tasks effortlessly.

With support for custom sections (like columns in Jira), it's perfect for managing sprints, personal to-dos, or team projectsâ€”without the complexity of enterprise tools.
